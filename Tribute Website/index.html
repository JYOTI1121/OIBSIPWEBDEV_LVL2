        <li><h2>Early Life</h2></li>
        <p>Rani Lakshmibai was born on <b>19 November 1828</b> in the town of <b>Varanasi</b>
        into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family. She was named <b>Manikarnika</b> and was called <i>Manu.</i>
        She was taught to read and write and was skilled in <b>Shooting</b>, <b>Horsemanship</b> and
         <b>Fencing</b>. 

    <br>
    <br>
        <b>Nana Sahib</b> and <b>Tantia Tope</b> were her childhood friends.
    <li><h2>Marriage</h2></li>   
        Manikarnika was married to the <i>Maharaja of Jhansi</i>, <b>Gangadhar Rao Newalkar</b>, 
        in <b>May 1842</b> and was afterwards called Lakshmibai / Laxmibai in honour of the Hindu Goddess 
        Devi Lakshmi (according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage).
        In <b>September 1851</b>, she gave birth to a son named <b>Damodar Rao </b>
        who died 4 months after birth. The maharaja then adopted his cousin's son <i>Anand Rao</i> and
        named him <b>Damodar Rao</b>. 
        <br>
        After Maharaja's death, the britishers rejected Damodar's claim to the throne since he was adopted and 
        annexed the state to its territories.

    <li><h2>The Revolt of 1857</h2></li>
        Rani was reluctant to rebel against the British. A massacre took place at Jhansi which made the sepoys 
        left Jhansi, and Rani handled the administration. In 1858, when Jhansi was beseiged by Sir Hugh Rose, 
        Rani defended Jhansi. 
    <br>
        Rani then fought for the independence along with Tatya Tope, Nana Sahib and Rao Sahib.

    <li><h2>Death</h2></li>
        On <b>18 June</b> in <b><i>Kotah-ki-Serai</i></b> near the <b>Phool Bagh</b> of <b>Gwalior</b>, 
        Rani with her commanded large Indian Force fought bravely against Captain Heneage and his squadron. 
        But later, she got injured and died.
    <br>
    <br>
        Her tomb is in the <b>Phool Bagh </b>in <b>Gwalior </b> where she took her last breath.
